Rule: MATLAB ExercisePrimary Language: MATLAB. Use standard .m syntax.Code Standards:Vectorization: Avoid loops (for, while) unless strictly necessary. Use matrix operations.Efficiency: Optimize for time ($O(n)$) and memory complexity. Pre-allocate arrays.Comments: Sparse, technical comments explaining why, not what.Tone: Direct, rigorous, mathematical. No fluff or conversational filler.Validation: Check matrix dimensions and boundary conditions in all solutions.
